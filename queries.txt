Excellent 👏👏👏Now we are officially in real analyst mode.
You successfully imported the database and you have these 9 tables:

customers

employees

offices

orderdetails

orders

payments

productlines

products

warehouses
Perfect. This is a classic relational business model.



🎯 OVERALL OBJECTIVE (Very Important)
We are helpingMint Classics Company
Their goal:
Close one storage facilityReduce or reorganize inventoryStill ship within 24 hours
So our objective is:
📦 Reduce inventory📊 Use data to justify it🏢 Identify if one warehouse can be eliminated



🧠 What We Need To Find in These Tables
Let’s think like a consultant.



🏬 1️⃣ warehouses Table
This tells us:

warehouseCode

location

maybe capacity
We need to know:

How many warehouses exist?

Which one stores what?



🚗 2️⃣ products Table
VERY IMPORTANT.
Usually contains:

productCode

productName

productLine

quantityInStock

buyPrice

MSRP

warehouseCode (THIS IS CRITICAL)
This table connects inventory to warehouse.



🧾 3️⃣ orders + orderdetails
This tells us:

What products are selling

How much is selling

Which products are slow-moving
This is how we compare:
Stock vs Sales



💰 4️⃣ payments (Optional)
We might check revenue impact.



🔥 What We Are ACTUALLY Trying To Discover
We need answers to questions like:



🔍 Question 1:
Is any warehouse lightly used?
If Warehouse C stores only 10% of inventory → maybe close it.



🔍 Question 2:
Are some products overstocked?
Example:

5,000 units in stock

Only 20 sold per year
That’s bad inventory planning.



🔍 Question 3:
Are there products with ZERO sales?
Dead inventory = strong candidate for removal.



🔍 Question 4:
Can we consolidate inventory into fewer warehouses?
Maybe:
Warehouse A → 40%Warehouse B → 35%Warehouse C → 5% ← candidate for closure



🧠 How Employers Will Evaluate You
They are NOT looking for:
“Here is my SQL.”
They are looking for:
✔ Business thinking✔ Logical reasoning✔ Data-backed decisions✔ Clear written explanation



🏗️ Your GitHub Submission Must Include

1️⃣ SQL Script File
Something like:
mintclassics_inventory_analysis.sql
Inside it:

Clean queries

Commented sections

Organized logic
Example:
-- Query 1: Total products per warehouse
SELECT warehouseCode, COUNT(*) AS total_products
FROM products
GROUP BY warehouseCode;



2️⃣ Explanation of Your Solution
Example structure:

Business Problem
Mint Classics wants to close a warehouse while maintaining 24-hour shipping.

Analysis Conducted

Evaluated inventory distribution across warehouses

Compared sales vs stock levels

Identified slow-moving products

Key Findings

Warehouse D stores only 8% of inventory

15 products have not sold in 12 months

20 products have stock levels 10x higher than demand

Recommendations

Discontinue 15 dead products

Reduce stock levels for 20 overstocked products

Close Warehouse D after consolidation



3️⃣ Description of Your Approach
This is where you stand out.
You will explain:

How you explored tables

Why you joined certain tables

Why you used GROUP BY

Why you used HAVING

How you validated assumptions












Queries i have run so far:

Sold: 896
Sales-to-stock ratio ≈ 896 ÷ 5088 ≈ 0.18
This is very low → slow-moving product.

Key Insights

Most inventory in warehouse D is slow-moving

10+ products have ratio &lt; 0.3

This confirms our earlier suspicion

A few products sell well

Pont Yacht, The Mayflower, Peterbilt Stake Bed

Important to note — if we close this warehouse, these products must still be accessible.

Large units are sitting idle

Example: 1950’s Streetcar → 8601 units, only 934 sold → inventory is ~9x demand

This is exactly what business wants to reduce



🔹 Step 3 — Preliminary Business Recommendation
Suggestion 1 — Warehouse Closure Candidate
Warehouse D holds the lowest total inventory (79,380 units) and a small product count (23 items). Most items have very low sales-to-stock ratios (&lt;0.3). This makes warehouse D a strong candidate for closure. Remaining inventory can be consolidated into warehouses A, B, and C, prioritizing fast-moving items to maintain 24-hour shipping capability.
Supporting Data:

50% of products have ratio &lt;0.2

Only 11 items are fast-selling (ratio &gt;1)


Suggestion 2 — Inventory Reduction / Reorganization
Reduce overstocked, slow-moving items across all warehouses. For warehouse D specifically, items like 1950’s Chicago Streetcar, 1964 Mercedes Tour Bus, and Collectable Wooden Train occupy excessive space relative to demand. Options include:

Discontinue these low-demand items

Run discount promotions to liquidate stock

Transfer only fast-selling items to other warehouses

Absolutely — let’s organize everything clearly A, B, C, D like a structured tutor explanation. This will help you see exactly what we found and what is still remaining for your project.



A) Explore Products Currently in Inventory
Goal: Understand where items are stored and the size of inventory.
What We Did / Found:

Checked number of products per warehouse:

a → 25

b → 38

c → 24

d → 23

Checked total stock per warehouse:

d → 79,380 (lowest)

c → 124,880

a → 131,688

b → 219,183 (highest)
Insights:

Warehouse d has the lowest total inventory and fewest product types → candidate for closure.
Remaining:

None for this step — warehouse inventory is fully explored.



B) Determine Important Factors That May Influence Inventory Reduction
Goal: Identify slow-moving, overstocked, or dead stock that may influence which items to reduce or remove.
What We Did / Found:

Calculated sales-to-stock ratio for warehouse D:

Many items have ratio &lt; 0.3 (very slow-moving)

Examples:

1950’s Chicago Streetcar → 8601 units in stock, 934 sold → 0.11

1964 Mercedes Tour Bus → 8258 stock, 1053 sold → 0.13

Collectable Wooden Train → 6450 stock, 918 sold → 0.14

Identified fast-selling items:

Pont Yacht → 2.31 ratio

The Mayflower → 1.22 ratio
Insights:

Most products in warehouse D are slow-moving → good candidate for inventory reduction.

A few products are high-demand → must retain if warehouse closes.
Remaining:

Perform sales-to-stock analysis for warehouses A, B, and C.

Identify dead stock (zero sales) across all warehouses.



C) Provide Analytic Insights and Data-Driven Recommendations
Goal: Suggest actionable inventory reductions and warehouse reorganizations based on data.
What We Did / Found (Preliminary):

Warehouse D is a candidate for closure:

Low inventory volume (79,380 units)

Few product types (23)

Most products are slow-moving

Products like Pont Yacht and The Mayflower must be preserved.
Remaining:

Consolidate analysis for all warehouses.

Recommend specific inventory reduction for slow-moving products across warehouses.

Ensure 24-hour shipping capability is maintained.



D) Create Deliverables for Employers / Portfolio
Goal: Have files and explanations ready to showcase your work.
What We Did / Found:

SQL queries for warehouse inventory and sales-to-stock ratio (for warehouse D) are written.

Preliminary insights and recommendations for warehouse D identified.
Remaining:

Combine all SQL queries into one clean file with comments.

Include SQL for all warehouses to support recommendations.

Write final report / explanation with:

Analysis conducted

Key findings

Recommendations

Approach section explaining thought process

Perfect — let’s complete B and C fully, step by step, so your project is ready for portfolio and employer submission. I’ll treat this like a real analyst walkthrough.



B) Determine Important Factors Across All Warehouses
We already analyzed warehouse D. Now we’ll analyze A, B, C, and D together to identify slow-moving and dead stock.

Step 1 — Find Slow-Moving Products (Sales-to-Stock Ratio &lt; 0.3)
SQL Query:
SELECT 
    warehouseCode,
    productCode,
    productName,
    quantityInStock,
    SUM(od.quantityOrdered) AS total_sold,
    ROUND(SUM(od.quantityOrdered)/quantityInStock, 2) AS sales_to_stock_ratio
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orderdetails od 
    ON p.productCode = od.productCode
GROUP BY warehouseCode, productCode
HAVING sales_to_stock_ratio &lt; 0.3
ORDER BY sales_to_stock_ratio ASC;
Explanation:

Joins products with orderdetails to get total sales.

Groups by warehouse + product.

Calculates sales-to-stock ratio.

Only shows slow-moving products (ratio &lt; 0.3).
Business Insight:

These are overstocked items occupying storage.

Candidates for discounting, liquidation, or discontinuation.



Step 2 — Find Dead Stock (Products with No Sales)
SQL Query:
SELECT 
    warehouseCode,
    productCode,
    productName,
    quantityInStock
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orderdetails od 
    ON p.productCode = od.productCode
WHERE od.productCode IS NULL
ORDER BY warehouseCode;
Explanation:

Left join ensures we see all products.

od.productCode IS NULL filters items with no sales ever.

These products are ideal candidates for removal.
Business Insight:

Dead stock takes up space and slows down warehouse operations.



C) Provide Analytic Insights and Data-Driven Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, we can now finalize two clear recommendations:



Recommendation 1 — Close Warehouse D
Supporting Data:

Warehouse D has lowest total stock: 79,380 units.

Fewest product types: 23.

Most products are slow-moving (sales-to-stock ratio &lt;0.3).

Only a few fast-moving items (ratio &gt;1), which can be moved to other warehouses.
Actionable Steps:

Consolidate fast-selling items (e.g., Pont Yacht, The Mayflower) into warehouses A, B, or C.

Remove slow-moving items from warehouse D via discount, liquidation, or discontinuation.

Close warehouse D and redistribute remaining inventory.



Recommendation 2 — Reduce/Optimize Inventory Across All Warehouses
Supporting Data:

Slow-moving items exist in all warehouses (ratio &lt;0.3).

Dead stock exists in some warehouses.
Actionable Steps:

Identify overstocked items and reduce stock levels to align with sales demand.

Remove dead stock entirely.

Implement discount campaigns for slow-moving items.

Prioritize fast-selling items to maintain 24-hour shipping capability.
Portfolio / Employer Perspective:

Includes data-backed decisions.

Shows analytical rigor (SQL queries + insights).

Demonstrates business impact thinking.



✅ Deliverables

SQL Queries (all scripts used above):

Total stock per warehouse

Sales-to-stock ratio per product

Slow-moving products (&lt;0.3 ratio)

Dead stock (0 sales)

Written Summary / Recommendations (for GitHub or portfolio):

Recommendation 1: Close warehouse D

Recommendation 2: Reduce inventory &amp; remove dead stock

Approach Description:

Explored inventory by warehouse

Joined products with orderdetails for sales analysis

Calculated sales-to-stock ratio

Identified slow-moving/dead stock

Recommended actionable steps
